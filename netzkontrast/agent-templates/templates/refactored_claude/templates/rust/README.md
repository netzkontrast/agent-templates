# Rust Claude Code Templates

## Coming Soon! üöß

We're actively working on creating comprehensive Claude Code templates for Rust development.

### What to Expect
- Best practices for Rust project structure
- Integration with popular Rust tools and frameworks
- Workflow optimizations for Rust development
- Testing and benchmarking configurations
- Cross-compilation and deployment setups
- Memory safety and performance guidelines

### Meanwhile...
You can use the [common templates](../common/README.md) as a starting point for your Rust projects. The universal guidelines and git workflows will work well with Rust development.
